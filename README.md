This library is simplified version of **Barbacoa Server Lib** logging feature. 
Removed **Boost** dependencies (except for unit-tests purposes).

* Some logging features was removed as was implemented with **Boost.Log**!
* Some comprehensive syntaxic from modern C++ standard was removed just to be compatible with old C++ standard.
